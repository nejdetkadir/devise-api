# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/spec/dummy/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/spec/dummy/db/*.sqlite3
/spec/dummy/db/*.sqlite3-*

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/spec/dummy/log/*
/spec/dummy/tmp/*
!/spec/dummy/log/.keep
!/spec/dummy/tmp/.keep

# Ignore pidfiles, but keep the directory.
/spec/dummy/tmp/pids/*
!/spec/dummy/tmp/pids/
!/spec/dummy/tmp/pids/.keep
